# Computer Control QA Test Report

## Test Environment
- Testing remote computer control via websocket stream
- Target URL: http://192.168.0.221:5000/
- Test Date: November 28, 2024

## Test Scenarios and Results

### 1. Browser Navigation
- ‚úÖ Successfully launched browser with specified URL
- ‚úÖ Menu button click (26,131) registers and opens side menu
- ‚úÖ Close menu button click (726,131) registers

### 2. Keyboard Input Status
- üîÑ Keyboard input implementation updated:
  - Enhanced key mapping system for special keys
  - Improved Enter key handling
  - Added input buffering system
  - Added focus management with visual indicators
  - Added detailed console logging for key events
- üîÑ Frontend improvements:
  - Added input buffering with controlled processing rate
  - Added visual focus indicator (green when focused, red when unfocused)
  - Enhanced focus management with mouseenter/mouseleave events
  - Added focus state to debug overlay
  - Improved special key handling
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Testing needed:
  - Verify input buffering prevents dropped keystrokes
  - Test focus management with visual indicators
  - Verify Enter key functionality
  - Test special key handling in various contexts

### 3. Technical Improvements

- Improved web interface:
  - Added input buffering system
  - Added focus state visualization
  - Enhanced error logging
  - Added focus state debugging

## Recent Changes

1. **Backend Updates**
   - Enhanced key mapping system in ComputerControl class
   - Added special key handling in web interface
   - Improved error logging and debugging
   - Added delay after Enter key press

2. **Frontend Updates**
   - Added input buffering system
   - Added visual focus indicators
   - Enhanced focus management
   - Added focus state debugging
   - Improved special key handling

## Next Steps

1. **Verification Needed**
   - Test input buffering prevents dropped keystrokes
   - Verify focus management with visual indicators
   - Test Enter key functionality with new implementation
   - Verify special key handling in different contexts

2. **Potential Improvements**
   - Monitor input buffer performance
   - Fine-tune input processing rate
   - Enhance focus management based on testing feedback

## Conclusion
Implementation has been updated with improved keyboard handling, input buffering, and focus management. Testing is needed to verify these improvements resolve the input delay and dropped keystroke issues.
