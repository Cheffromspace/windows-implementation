# Computer Control QA Test Report

## Test Environment
- Testing remote computer control via websocket stream
- Target URL: http://192.168.0.221:5000/
- Browser redirects to NYTimes Wordle (https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle)
- Test Date: November 28, 2024

## Test Scenarios and Results

### 1. Browser Navigation
- ✅ Successfully launched browser with specified URL
- ✅ Browser successfully redirects to NYTimes Wordle
- ✅ Menu button click (26,131) registers and opens side menu
- ✅ Close menu button click (726,131) registers

### 2. Game Interaction Status
- 🔄 Keyboard input implementation updated:
  - Added key mapping system for special keys
  - Enhanced Enter key handling
  - Added console logging for key events
  - Improved event prevention for browser shortcuts
- 🔄 Frontend improvements:
  - Added explicit prevention of default behavior for Enter key
  - Included additional key event metadata (code property)
  - Enhanced debug logging for keyboard events
- ⚠️ Testing in progress:
  - Letter input working
  - Enter key submission needs verification after updates
  - Virtual keyboard interaction partially working

### 3. Technical Observations
- Browser actions execute without errors
- Click coordinates are properly received and processed
- Keyboard input system refactored:
  - Added mapping between DOM key events and pyautogui commands
  - Improved special key handling (Enter, Backspace, etc.)
  - Enhanced error logging for debugging
- Console logs show successful connection

## Recent Changes

1. **Backend Updates**
   - Implemented key mapping system in ComputerControl class
   - Added special key translation (Enter -> enter, etc.)
   - Enhanced error logging for keyboard events
   - Improved handling of key combinations

2. **Frontend Updates**
   - Enhanced keydown event handler
   - Added prevention of default behavior for special keys
   - Improved event metadata collection
   - Added debug logging for key events

## Next Steps

1. **Verification Needed**
   - Test Enter key functionality with new implementation
   - Verify special key handling
   - Test virtual keyboard interaction

2. **Potential Improvements**
   - Add more detailed logging for keyboard event flow
   - Consider alternative input methods if needed
   - Monitor game state changes more closely

## Conclusion
Implementation has been updated to handle special keys more effectively. Testing is needed to verify the improvements in keyboard handling, particularly for the Enter key and game state interactions.
