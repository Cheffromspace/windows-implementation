# Keyboard Mapping Issue Resolution

## Issue Description
A keyboard mapping issue was occurring when interacting with a remote Windows environment through a browser interface. Characters were being scrambled in a systematic pattern due to a mismatch between the local Colemak keyboard layout and the remote system's QWERTY interpretation.

Example:
- Intended: "Hello! This is a test of the remote Windows environment."
- Actual: "hlelo !Tih SSA It es teht r emt eod sweoniwfonii"

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from three main factors:
1. User's local system using Colemak keyboard layout
2. Browser capturing keyboard events based on physical key positions
3. Remote Windows system interpreting these events using QWERTY mapping

## Solution Implemented
Added keyboard layout handling to the ComputerControl class:

1. Configuration Enhancement:
   - Added keyboard layout setting to track the user's keyboard configuration
   - Default configuration now includes: `"keyboard_settings": {"layout": "colemak"}`

2. Mapping Implementation:
   - Created comprehensive Colemak-to-QWERTY mapping dictionary
   - Covers both lowercase and uppercase characters
   - Preserves special characters and keyboard combinations

3. Key Processing Updates:
   - Modified key_press() method to apply mapping for regular characters
   - Updated key_combination() to handle mapped keys with modifiers
   - Enhanced type_text() to map entire strings of text

4. Logging Improvements:
   - Added detailed logging of key mapping transformations
   - Helps track and debug keyboard input processing

## Testing
The solution can be tested by typing the same test message:
```
Hello! This is a test of the remote Windows environment.
```

The system will now:
1. Receive the Colemak keyboard input
2. Map it to the corresponding QWERTY keys
3. Send the correct keystrokes to the remote Windows system

## Benefits
- Preserves correct character output regardless of keyboard layout
- Maintains support for special keys and keyboard combinations
- Provides detailed logging for troubleshooting
- Configurable through settings without code changes

## Future Considerations
- Support for additional keyboard layouts could be added
- Configuration could be made dynamic through UI
- Performance monitoring for high-speed typing scenarios
